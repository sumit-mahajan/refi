            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr></hr>
            {/* <Box height={20} /> */}
            <p>Refi, (Reputation + Finance) is a variable rate lending and borrowing protocol that
                maintains a credit score for its users and provides benefits to them accordingly. It takes its
                core functionality from AAVE v2.
            </p>

            <h2>Terminologies</h2>
            <hr></hr>
            {/* <Box height={20} /> */}
            <p>Few of the core Terminologies used in Refi are explained below</p>
            <Box height={20} />
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collateral</strong> - The collateral is basically a security deposit,
                    which the protocol can claim if you fail to repay the loan. Loans in Refi are over-collateralized
                    i.e. you have to deposit more assets than you can borrow. Anything you deposit on the protocol
                    is automatically used as collateral to provide you additional borrowing capacity</li>
                <Box height={15} />
                <li><strong>LTV</strong> - LTV or Loan To Value ratio is the ratio of debt amount to the value of collateral deposited.
                    The LTV for individual asset is the percentage value of total collateral, that can be borrowed
                    in the corresponding asset.
                </li>
                <Box height={15} />
                <li><strong>Liquidation Threshold</strong> - Due to market conditions, the ETH equivalent value
                    of the assets you borrowed and deposited will change. Liquidation Threshold is the
                    maximum ratio of borrowed ETH value to deposited ETH value, beyond which your loan is considered
                    as a "Default" and can be liquidated</li>
                <Box height={15} />
                <li><strong>Health Factor</strong> - Health factor is the ratio of maximum value allowed to borrow
                    to the value actually borrowed.</li>
                <Box height={15} />
                <li><strong>Liquidation</strong> - In the event of a negative price fluctuation of the
                    debt asset (i.e. Health Factor falls below 1), a loan can be liquidated.
                    Anyone can repay the debt and claim the collateral + extra bonus of the defaulter.</li>
                <Box height={15} />
                <li><strong>Liquidation Penalty</strong> - When a liquidator liquidates a debt of a borrower,
                    they pay the user's debt and recieve equivalent amount of user's collateal + some extra
                    percentage of the collateral i.e. Liquidation Penalty
                </li>
                <Box height={15} />
                <li><strong>Deposit APY</strong> - Deposit Annual Percentage Yield is the interest in percentage terms that
                    can be earned on deposited asset in a year, if the current state of the protocol persists.
                </li>
                <Box height={15} />
                <li><strong>Borrow APY</strong> - Borrow Annual Percentage Yield is the interest in percentage terms that
                    that has to be paid on borrowed asset in a year, if the current state of the protocol persists.
                </li>
                <Box height={15} />
                <li><strong>Percentage Utilization</strong> - Ratio of total amount borrowed to the total amount
                    supplied in an asset.</li>
                <Box height={15} />
                <li><strong>Variable Rate</strong> - Refi is a variable rate based protocol i.e. Deposit and Borrow APYs are adjusted
                    after every transaction using the amount of asset deposited and amount of asset borrowed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Credit Scores</h2>
            <hr></hr>
            {/* <Box height={20} /> */}
            <p>Your credit score is a number between 300â€“900 that represents your creditworthiness.
                The higher the score, the higher you can borrow against the deposited collateral. </p>
            <Box height={20} />

            <h3>Factors used in calculating credit score</h3>
            <Box height={20} />

            <p>We analyzed exisiting credit scoring models like FICO and Vantagescore for
                the factors they use for calculating credit score. Based on that, we have identified the
                following 3 highest impact factors and used them in Defi perspective as follows:
            </p>
            <Box height={15} />
            <p><strong>1. Payment history</strong> - It tracks your borrowing history and takes into account, the liquidations that occur.
                Maintain your loan without any Liquidation to have a good credit score. Every time you liquidate,
                your credit score drops by 50-200 points depending on your current score.
            </p>
            <Box height={15} />
            <p><strong>2. Credit utilization</strong> - It is the percentage of total amount you have borrowed
                with respect to the maximum amount you are allowed to borrow. Credit utilization of 85% is considered
                optimal and results in fastest increase in credit score. The rate of increase of credit score
                increases with credit utilization till 85% and falls after that since borrowing any more is considered riskier.</p>
            <Box height={15} />
            <p><strong>3. Credit history</strong> - It is the time period over which you have maintained your borrowed loan.
                Borrowing any amount results in continuous increase of credit score with time. The rate of increase however
                is determined by Credit utilization.

            {/* <Box height={20} /> */}
            <p>Users can get their credit card by minting it as an NFT from their Dashboard page. There are four types of cards
                Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Based on the users current class, respective type of card is provided with users address printed on it. As the users class changes the type of card also changes dynamic without having to re-mint. 
                <Box height={10} />
                The reason for providing a credit card is that in future we plan on providing a feature wherein this credit card could be used as a real credit card. This would allow the user to pay on other DAPPs using their card. This would be achieved by creating a borrow position of equivalent amount on user's behalf on the Refi protocol.
